# Bootcamp_Wk5_Homework

On starting this project, I saw that there were several lines of code already in place for me to use.  This was fortuitous because it helped to guide me through the expectations of the project; but it was a hinderance because some of the code was different than how I would tackle the problem, and it became something to walk around or trip over.

The expectations of this single-paged "daily planner" was to present the user with the current day when they open the page.  When they scroll down the page, they were presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, 9am to 5pm, to be specific.  Each of the timeblocks were to be color-coded to indicate whether or not they were in the past (grey), present (pastel red), or the future (green).  When the user clicks on a timeblock, they can enter text for that hour.  When they click the disk icon on the right to save the event, it persists even if the user refreshes the page.

This was the first time I've ever used moment.js, and I look forward to future projects with this powerful tool.  I also added the "placeholder" element for the default/guide text in each text field.  The placeholder element makes the default/guide text disappear when the user starts typing.

Onward to the next project.
